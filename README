Fossa (pronounced "FOO-sa") is a very simple to use agile project management tool built with Ruby on Rails that helps small teams develop software in a iterative manner.
How does Fossa work?

   1. Create your project
   2. Add features to your project
   3. Create an iteration
   4. Add tasks to your iteration
   5. Seek feedback from your customer
   6. Repeat steps 3 & 4 until feature is complete
